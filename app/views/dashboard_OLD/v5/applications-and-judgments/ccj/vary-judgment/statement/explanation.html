          <h3 class="heading-medium">Why you need to do this</h3>

          <p>Your answers will be sent to Jan Clark to explain why you can't pay the full amount now. They can choose to accept or reject your payment plan.</p>


          <h3 class="heading-medium">What you'll need</h3>

          <p>You'll need to provide details of:

          <ul class="list list-bullet">
            <li>monthly bills and expenses</li>
            <li>monthly income and benefits</li>

            Settle out of court
          </h2>
          <p>You might be able to resolve the dispute without going to court. You can do this as part of completing your defence to the claim.</p>

          <p>If you reject the claim or admit you owe less than the full amount claimed, you can make an offer or ask for mediation to settle the claim.

          <h2 class="heading-medium">
            Make an offer
          </h2>
          <p>You can try to settle the claim by making the claimant an offer. For example, you could offer to repair damage you have caused to the claimant’s property or replace faulty goods you supplied them.</p>

          <p>If the claimant rejects your offer you’ll have to go a hearing. The claimant can’t mention that you made them an offer at the hearing.
          </p>
          <h2 class="heading-medium">
            Mediate
          </h2>
          <p>You can ask for mediation to settle the claim. If the claimant agrees to use the mediation service, you could settle the claim without going to court.</p> -->

          </ul>
          <h3 class="heading-small" >Admit part of the claim</h3>
          <p>If you think the claim is too high you can offer the amount you think you owe as part of your defence. You’ll get the chance to explain why your offer is the amount you believe you owe.</p>

          </ul>
          <h3 class="heading-small">Reject the claim</h3>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">Terms of the agreement</h3>
        <p>This agreement settles the claim made by Jan Clark against Mary Richards. This includes all money owed in the case, for example counterclaims, court fees, expenses or interest.</p>
        <p>This agreement replaces the claim. Neither of you can make any further claims relating to this case.</p>

        <p>This agreement is confidential until you've both signed it. After that it can be used in court, for example if the agreement is broken.

        <p>You can view and download this agreement at any time from your money claims account.</p>

        <h3 class="heading-medium">If the agreement is broken</h3>
        <p>Either of you can apply to:</p>
        <ul class="list list-bullet">
          <li>request a judgment for any money still owed from this agreement</li>
          <li>restart the original claim or counterclaim for the full amount of the claim</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should complete form N244</a> and send it to the <a href="">County Court Business Centre</a>. You need to say on the form which of the 2 options you're applying for.</a></p>
        <p>The original claim and any counterclaims will be kept on hold in case this agreement is broken. They will be closed on [date] if we don't hear from either of you.</p>

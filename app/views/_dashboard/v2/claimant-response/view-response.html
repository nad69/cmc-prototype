        Mary Richards response

      <h2 class="heading-small">Their response to your claim</h2>
      <p>


        The defendant has rejected your claim.


      </p>


      <p class="heading-small">Why they rejected your claim</p>

      <p>The work on the roof was completed as per the contract.</p>
      <p>Jan says she contacted me but I didn't get a call or an email - I'd have been happy to take a look at the roof
        and see if there was a problem. There shouldn't be a need to get someone else in and the quote of Â£1,500 sounds
        high.

      <p class="heading-small">Their evidence</p>
      <p>I didn't get an email from Jan about this, so I didn't get a chance to sort it out. It would be good to see a
        copy of the email. </p>

      <p class="heading-small">How this dispute has affected them</p>

      <p>I'm sorry you have felt stress during this process but would like claim resolved amicably.</p>

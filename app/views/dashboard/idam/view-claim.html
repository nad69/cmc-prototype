      <h2 class="heading-small">Reason for claim:</h2>
      <p>This claim is about building works.</p>
      <p>Mary Richards and I signed a contract for building works on my roof. The work on the roof was completed but
        there was a problem with one section. I asked Mary Richards to get the problem fixed, but didn't get a
      reply.</p> <p>I'll have to get another builder to rectify the problem which will cost me £1,500.</P> <p>Therefore, I'm making a money
      claim for £1,500 to compensate for the extra money I'm going to need to spend.</p>

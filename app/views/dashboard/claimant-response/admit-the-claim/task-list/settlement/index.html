      <p>A settlement agreement is a legal agreement between you and the defendant describing how and when they will repay you.</p>
      <p>If the defendant chooses to sign your agreement, the claim will be put on hold and you will not be able to issue a CCJ against them unless they break the agreement.</p>
      <p>If they do not feel the repayment plan is affordable, they can ask a judge to determine a suitable plan.</p>
